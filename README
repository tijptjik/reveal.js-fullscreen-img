Reveal.js fullscreen image plugin for Markdown
---------------------------------

This is a simple plugin to insert full screen images in your presentations. 

The original plugin was ideal for slides written in HTML, but wasn't as great
if your slides were authored with MarkDown. The current implementation looks for
an image on the current slide which has its `alt` property set to 'fullscreen'.

Fullscreen images can be inserted into your markdown slides as such:

    ![fullscreen](IMAGE-LOCATION)

To use this plugin, you will need to use both the included js script and stylesheet:

* copy fullscreen-img.js to your plugins/fullscreen-img/ folder
* copy fullscreen-img.css to your css/ folder
* include both files in your presentation:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/fullscreen-img.css">
    <script>
      Reveal.initialize({
        ...
        dependencies: [
          ...
          { src: 'plugin/fullscreen-img/fullscreen.js' },
          ...
        ]
        ...
      });
    </script>

Then, you can add fullscreen images to any slide by adding an image anywhere 
in that section:

    ## My Little Ponies
    ![fullscreen](img/my_little_ponies.png)

    * Rescue at Midnight Castle
    * Escape from Catrina
    * My Little Pony: The Movie
